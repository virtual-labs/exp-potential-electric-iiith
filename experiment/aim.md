### Aim of the experiment
 One of the basic and most popular problems in semiconductors is the effect of non uniform doping of the semiconductor. In this section of the virtual labs, few non-uniform doped semiconductors cases will be presented. internal built in potential, electric field, charge density, effect of biasing etc. will be studied via the simulations. subsubsection<br>

Need for virtual experiment Semiconductor device physics is difficult to visualize due to its abstract nature and hence, many students develop a fear or dislike for the subject.<br>
 
By the mode of virtual labs, students will be able to visualize the changes happening in the semiconductor as they vary an input parameter and will be able to visualize the effect in real time directly in the cross section and also see if there is any change in current following through the system.
