## Procedure
There user is presented with two tasks: 
#### task 1
Identify which plot is unbiased, reverse biased and forward biased. Since all the waveforms of each space charge density function function look the same, all of them are plotted in the same graph. There are 3 text boxes present on the graph and each one is placed near each plot.<br> 
The unbiased plot is considered to be 'a'<br>
The forward biased plot is considered to be 'b'<br>
The reverse biased plot is considered to be 'c'<br>
The user has to type "a", "b" or "c" in each text box to indetify the plots and press the submit button to verify their answers.
#### task 2
Identify which plot is uniformly doped junction, linearly graded junction and hyperabrupt junction. There are 3 space charge density plots on the left, one of each type. The user is to match each plot to its correct label on the right and press submit button to verify their answers
